# Chapter 33: Case Study: Video Sales

Below is the details of the case study proposed by the author. This is a great discussion point:

- We have a batch of videos we want to sell. We sell them, on the web, to both individuals and businesses.
- Individuals can pay one price to stream the videos, and another, higher price to download those videos and own them permanently.
- Business licenses are streaming only, and are purchased in batches that allow quantity discounts.
- Individuals typically act as both the viewers and the purchasers.
- Businesses, in contrast, often have people who buy the videos that other people will watch.
- Video authors need to supply their video files, written descriptions, and ancillary files with exams, problems, solutions, source code, and other materials.
- Administrators need to add new video series, add and delete videos to and from the series, and establish prices for various licenses.

Our first step in determining the initial architecture of the system is to identify the actors and use cases.
