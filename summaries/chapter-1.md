# Chapter 1: What is Design and Architecture?

Design and Architecture are the same thing. And so it is with software design. The low-level details and the high-level structure are all part of the same whole. The goal of software architecture is to minimize the Human Resources required to build and maintain the required system. The requirement of human effort should not grow with each release.

In the early phases, with quick and dirty work, the number of devs is the driver of output. But with each release, productivity declines and the cost per line of code rises. And this doesn’t mean people aren’t working hard.

Insert analogy of tortoise and the hare

We lie to ourselves. We’ll clean it up later. Go to market now, but the market pressures never abate. Then we need to stay ahead of market. We never switch modes. “Making messes is always slower than staying clean.” “The only way to go fast, is to go well” “Overconfidence will drive the redesign into the same mess as the original project”

_In Summary_: This is why you need to consider architecture from day 1.
